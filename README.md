# Simulator-Module
## Overview

This repository contains a set of XML files required for recreating a simulator environment. It is a complementary repository to provide additional information given in the paper- "Controller Design and Remote Piloting Training Module Development for Unmanned Cropped Delta Reflex Wing Configuration". The given XML files define various parameters, configurations, and settings necessary for running the simulator.
The reader has to include his own aircraft model and change the name "cropped_delta.ac" to aircraft_name.ac when using these files. The model used in the research paper is proprietary and not shared here to prevent its distribution.
