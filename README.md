# Simulator-Module
**Overview**

This repository contains a set of XML files required for recreating a simulator environment. These XML files define various parameters, configurations, and settings necessary for running the simulator.
The reader has to include his own aircraft model and change the name- "cropped_delta.ac" to aircraft_name.ac for using these files.
